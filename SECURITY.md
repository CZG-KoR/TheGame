# Security Policy

The project/repository management team takes security issues very seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any security vulnerabilities you find.

## Supported Versions

We are committed to providing security updates and support for our project to ensure the best possible experience for our users. 
As part of this commitment, we offer support for specific project versions. Currently, the following versions are actively supported and receive security updates:

| Version      | Supported          |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| UNRELEASED   | :x:                |

Please note that while we focus our efforts on maintaining security for these versions, older versions may not receive the same level of attention. 
We strongly recommend that users keep their installations up to date to benefit from the latest features and security enhancements.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
